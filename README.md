# RFM Analysis – Customer Segmentation & Marketing Strategy

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis** to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.  
The goal is to identify high-value customers, inactive customers, and growth opportunities, and to map each segment with actionable marketing strategies.

The dataset contains transactional retail data including invoices, product details, customer information, purchase dates, and revenue.

## 🧮 RFM Metrics Explained
- **Recency (R):** Number of days since the customer’s last purchase

Each metric is scored and combined to create an **RFM Score**, which is used for customer segmentation.
